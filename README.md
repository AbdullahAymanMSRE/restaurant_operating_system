# EUI Restaurant Operating System

## Introduction

This is an operating system designed for restaurants. It contains three programs:

- one to serve clients
- one for staff members to maintain orders
- one to show orders' statuses

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following commands in the terminal:

   ```bash
          ⁠chmod +x restaurant ./bash_helpers/client.sh ./bash_helpers/compile.sh ./bash_helpers/welcome.sh
   ```

   to make the scripts executable

   then run:

   ```bash
           ⁠sudo mv . /usr/bin/
   ```

   to move the scripts to the `/usr/bin/` directory to be able to run them from anywhere in the terminal

## Usage

Run `⁠⁠sudo restaurant` in the terminal to start the system.
